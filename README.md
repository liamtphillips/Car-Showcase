This app is a car showcase website built with React. It allows users to select a car from a list and view detailed information about the selected car, including its image, description, top speed, engine size, acceleration, and year built. Users can also go back to the car selection screen.


It uses the useState hook to manage the state of the selected car. The component displays a list of cars and their titles. When a car is clicked, its details (image, description, specifications) are displayed. Clicking the "Back" button returns to the car selection screen. The car data is stored in an array of objects and is rendered dynamically based on the selected car's state.
